When it's your turn, type a spell name or a description of an attack into the input box.

Press the "Fight!" button or hit the Enter key.

Watch as the game logs your spell's name, description, and the damage it deals (as determined by the Gemini API).

Your opponent will then take their turn.

Defeat your opponent by reducing their health to 0.
