Turn-Based Combat: You and your opponent take turns casting spells.

Dynamic Spell System: Type in any spell you can think of (e.g., "Expelliarmus," "a giant blast of fire," "tickle charm"). The Gemini API interprets your prompt and assigns a spell name, description, and damage value between 0 and 70.

Animated Duels: Watch unique spell projectiles fly across the screen and see sprites shake when hit.

Progressive Opponents: Battle your way through a lineup of increasingly difficult wizards, from Draco Malfoy to Lord Voldemort.

Health & Score: Keep track of your health, your opponent's health, and your total score.

Simple Controls: All you need is your keyboard to type and a mouse to click "Fight!" or "Restart."

How to Play

Open wizard-duel.html in your web browser.

When it's your turn, type a spell name or a description of an attack into the input box.

Press the "Fight!" button or hit the Enter key.

Watch as the game logs your spell's name, description, and the damage it deals (as determined by the Gemini API).

Your opponent will then take their turn.

Defeat your opponent by reducing their health to 0.

A new, more challenging opponent will appear.

Defeat all opponents to become the champion!

If you are defeated, or if you want to start over, press the "Restart" button.
